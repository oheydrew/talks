## The Lowdown

I joined in on a day of lightning talks @ Xplor earlier in the week, and decided to talk about Elixir from a much more beginners/non-FP coder's perspective- We have a lot of devs on our team who don't use the language, and I thought it might be a nice primer to talk about some basic concepts.

I speak in high-level terms about the concept of Pattern Matching, to begin with, and then move into the `with` statement, which uses pattern matching to great effect when one needs to generate multi-stage pipelines of functions, and handle errors at each stage.

No video of myself here, and it's a pretty raw cut, but I'm happy with how it turned out :)
