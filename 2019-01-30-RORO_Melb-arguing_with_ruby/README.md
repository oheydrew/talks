This will be my first talk, so I wanted to scope it to something specific and short in order to keep it to time and not get too carried away. 

## The Lowdown

Ruby is *super* flexible when it comes to providing arguments to it's methods. So much so, that it can get mighty overwhelming for the beginner. `key: value` pairs inside method definitions? default argument values? and "keyword arguments"? *What the heck is a `**args`, anyway?* - In this talk, I hope to demystify some of the "magic" behind how we define, and call our methods inside the ruby syntax- Starting small with Positional Arguments, all the way up to that crazy, cool-yet-initially-confusing "Seattle Style" bracket-less code we see all throughout Rails. 

Oh. And Pirate puns. Because Pirates, love `ARGS`.
